# ðŸ¥‹ Kata Starter

Kata Starter is the easiest and fastest way to start solving any kata. It includes `solution.js` file and structured tests in `solution.test.js`.

## Quickstart

If you are planning to start solving a new kata, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repo

```bash
> npx degit berlin-js-tech-group/kata-starter kata-name
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
> npm i
```

3. Run tests

```bash
> npm test

# or test a specific file
> npm test -- file.js
```

If you are planning to share your solution with already existing kata repo, follow the steps below:

1. Fork this repo

2. Add your solution and test files to `/src` folder with the following name format: "solution.<i>username</i>.js" and "solution.<i>username</i>.test.js".

3. Create a pull request with short explanation and results of tests run.

## Why

We, [@Berlin-JS-Tech-Group](https://github.com/Berlin-JS-Tech-Group), solve katas every meetup and members have been spending extra time on configuring and setting up the project to work on a kata. That was "why" we created this simple starter. Also it helps us to keep the same structure among already solved katas and helps members to easily contribute their solutions.
